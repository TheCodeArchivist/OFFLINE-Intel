### Preliminary Analysis of the Collide's Spatio-Temporal Distortion Capabilities

#### Introduction

The Collide has demonstrated the capability of creating **Temporal Irrationality Zones**.

These zones are randomly created in areas the Collide managed to spread to. If any living organisms step within this zone,
they may have a chance to be teleported to an alternative dimension.

As of now, we have limited data to describe the interior of said dimension, however, from the only 2 out of 14 test subjects sent through those T.I.Z which managed to return,
Expandable (StMil6) E-0977 reported an 'abstract' and 'brutalist' structure made out of old walls, while E-0982 explained a dimension coated with bright red walls with an inverted-pyramid like shape.

Research & Development, seeking to contain those concerning zones within St. Milena-6 and therefore avoiding it spreading all around the world,
managed to make an upgrade to the facility's reactor core by using technologies from Subject 301 ('Entropy Cube').
The reactor core initially running on nuclear fission has been replaced with a Quantum Entropy Core, providing higher engergy output by feeding it biomass / expendable personnel,
and allowing for tighter temporal control on the Collide, preventing its propagation outside of its containment facilities.

This reactor is currently located in Sector F and operated from two control rooms, one in Sector F, and another in Sector A.

It **MUST be kept online** at all times at at **minimum 60% operational capacity**. Otherwise there is a high risk of the **Collide breaching out of entropy containment**, and seeping into several parts of the facility,
or worse, **outside any secure perimeter**.
