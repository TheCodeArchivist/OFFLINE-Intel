## Data

```plaintext
<1361> : Contamination status is at 71%
<1011> : Any words from Locus?
<1361> : Negative, his squad hasn't replied in an hour
<1011> : This isn't good
<1011> : We have to move positions
<1361> : We can't, there's still the site wide lockdown. I can't try to move to Sector D nor Sector E
<1011> : Can't we try to put C4 on one of the weak walls on Zone 8 and detonate it?
<1361> : We risk worsening the breach!
<1011> : We do not have any choices. Ever since I saw that Collide beacon at the end of the corridor I knew this sector was completely fucked
<1361> : Right, even if we do that, where can we find the C4? This facility's not supposed to have any
<1011> : It does, but we need to reach the mines where they were doing the excavations for the upcoming Level-7
<1361> : Ok, I will proceed through the Containment Operations offices to reach the mines, that seems to be the faster way, and the only one that hasn't crumbled down yet
<1011> : Huh, watch out, the Collide weakened the overall structure stability there, I've heard the offices could sink at any rate 
<1361> : I don't have a choice, it's either that or I'll have to proceed to Level-5 where these humanoid fuckers are lurking everywhere
<1011> : Copy. Agent Volgrin, signing out
