Welcome to Serenitas Incorporated's latest innovation in Anomalous Containment facilities!

Our incorporation team is proud to onboard you within Station Milena-6.


### The facility

Station Milena-6 is a flagship high-tech facility located on Ronograd Island.
After a deal secured between PoD and PL5. Our organization managed to peacefully build our latest site right underneath the PoD's radar station.
Granding us access to long-range communication equipment, and fiber-grade network connections for our beloved employees.

This site houses brand new employee housing, a fully fleshed out Administration Sector, several resting areas,
a military grade Automated Facility Defense Systems (A.F.D.S) alongside a centralized AI system ('Alice') capable of monitoring all containments,
critical structures and most importantly, employees.

Our radical investments for employee hapiness and safety increased this facility's productivity by 190%, and their safety by 500% as there hasn't ever been a single accident ever since our opening in March 2025.
